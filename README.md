# RocketPy

RocketPy is the next-generation trajectory simulation solution for High-Power Rocketry. The code is written as a [Python](http://www.python.org) library and allows for a complete 6 degrees of freedom simulation of a rocket's flight trajectory, including high fidelity variable mass effects as well as descent under parachutes. Weather conditions, such as wind profile, can be imported from sophisticated datasets, allowing for realistic scenarios. Furthermore, the implementation facilitates complex simulations, such as multi-stage rockets, design and trajectory optimization and dispersion analysis.

# Previewing

You can preview RocketPy's main functionalities by browsing through a sample notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RocketPy-Team/rocketpy/blob/master/docs/notebooks/getting_started_colab.ipynb).  No installation required!

When you are ready to run RocketPy locally, you can read the *Getting Started* section!

<br>

# Getting Started

## Quick Installation

To install RocketPy's latest stable version from PyPI, just open up your terminal and run:

```shell
pip install rocketpy
```

For other installation options, visit our [Installation Docs](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/installation.html).
To learn more about RocketPy's requirements, visit our [Requirements Docs](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/requirements.html).

## Running Your First Simulation

In order to run your first rocket trajectory simulation using RocketPy, you can start a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the _nbks_ folder. Open _Getting Started - Examples.ipynb_ and you are ready to go.

Otherwise, you may want to create your own script or your own notebook using RocketPy. To do this, let's see how to use RocketPy's four main classes:

- Environment - Keeps data related to weather.
- SolidMotor - Keeps data related to solid motors. Hybrid motor support is coming in the next weeks.
- Rocket - Keeps data related to a rocket.
- Flight - Runs the simulation and keeps the results.

The following image shows how the four main classes interact with each other:

![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketPy-Team/RocketPy/master/docs/static/Fluxogram-Page-2.svg)

A typical workflow starts with importing these classes from RocketPy:

```python
from rocketpy import Environment, Rocket, SolidMotor, Flight
```

Then create an Environment object. To learn more about it, you can use:

```python
help(Environment)
```

A sample code is:

```python
Env = Environment(
    railLength=5.2,
    latitude=32.990254,
    longitude=-106.974998,
    elevation=1400,
    date=(2020, 3, 4, 12) # Tomorrow's date in year, month, day, hour UTC format
) 

Env.setAtmosphericModel(type='Forecast', file='GFS')
```

This can be followed up by starting a Solid Motor object. To get help on it, just use:

```python
help(SolidMotor)
```

A sample Motor object can be created by the following code:

```python
Pro75M1670 = SolidMotor(
    thrustSource="../data/motors/Cesaroni_M1670.eng",
    burnOut=3.9,
    grainNumber=5,
    grainSeparation=5/1000,
    grainDensity=1815,
    grainOuterRadius=33/1000,
    grainInitialInnerRadius=15/1000,
    grainInitialHeight=120/1000,
    nozzleRadius=33/1000,
    throatRadius=11/1000,
    interpolationMethod='linear'
)
```

With a Solid Motor defined, you are ready to create your Rocket object. As you may have guessed, to get help on it, use:

```python
help(Rocket)
```

A sample code to create a Rocket is:

```python
Calisto = Rocket(
    motor=Pro75M1670,
    radius=127/2000,
    mass=19.197-2.956,
    inertiaI=6.60,
    inertiaZ=0.0351,
    distanceRocketNozzle=-1.255,
    distanceRocketPropellant=-0.85704,
    powerOffDrag='../data/calisto/powerOffDragCurve.csv',
    powerOnDrag='../data/calisto/powerOnDragCurve.csv'
)

Calisto.setRailButtons([0.2, -0.5])

NoseCone = Calisto.addNose(length=0.55829, kind="vonKarman", distanceToCM=0.71971)

FinSet = Calisto.addTrapezoidalFins(4, span=0.100, rootChord=0.120, tipChord=0.040, distanceToCM=-1.04956)

Tail = Calisto.addTail(topRadius=0.0635, bottomRadius=0.0435, length=0.060, distanceToCM=-1.194656)
```

You may want to add parachutes to your rocket as well:

```python
def drogueTrigger(p, y):
    return True if y[5] < 0 else False

def mainTrigger(p, y):
    return True if y[5] < 0 and y[2] < 800 else False

Main = Calisto.addParachute('Main',
                            CdS=10.0,
                            trigger=mainTrigger, 
                            samplingRate=105,
                            lag=1.5,
                            noise=(0, 8.3, 0.5))

Drogue = Calisto.addParachute('Drogue',
                              CdS=1.0,
                              trigger=drogueTrigger, 
                              samplingRate=105,
                              lag=1.5,
                              noise=(0, 8.3, 0.5))
```

Finally, you can create a Flight object to simulate your trajectory. To get help on the Flight class, use:

```python
help(Flight)
```

To actually create a Flight object, use:

```python
TestFlight = Flight(rocket=Calisto, environment=Env, inclination=85, heading=0)
```

Once the TestFlight object is created, your simulation is done! Use the following code to get a summary of the results:

```python
TestFlight.info()
```

To see all available results, use:

```python
TestFlight.allInfo()
```

Here is just a quick taste of what RocketPy is able to calculate. There are hundred of plots and data points computed by RocketPy to enhance your analyses.
