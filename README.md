# RocketPy

RocketPy is the next-generation trajectory simulation solution for High-Power Rocketry. The code is written as a [Python](http://www.python.org) library and allows for a complete 6 degrees of freedom simulation of a rocket's flight trajectory, including high-fidelity variable mass effects as well as descent under parachutes. Weather conditions, such as wind profiles, can be imported from sophisticated datasets, allowing for realistic scenarios. Furthermore, the implementation facilitates complex simulations, such as multi-stage rockets, design and trajectory optimization and dispersion analysis.


## Main features

1. **Nonlinear 6 Degrees of Freedom Simulations**
   - Rigorous treatment of mass variation effects
   - Efficiently solved using LSODA with adjustable error tolerances
   - Highly optimized for fast performance

2. **Accurate Weather Modeling**
   - Supports International Standard Atmosphere (1976)
   - Custom atmospheric profiles and Soundings (Wyoming)
   - Weather forecasts, reanalysis, and ensembles for realistic scenarios

3. **Aerodynamic Models**
   - Optional Barrowman equations for lift coefficients
   - Easy import of drag coefficients from other sources (e.g., CFD simulations)

4. **Parachutes with External Trigger Functions**
   - Test the exact code that will fly
   - Sensor data augmentation with noise for comprehensive parachute simulations

5. **Solid, Hybrid, and Liquid Motors Models**
   - Burn rate and mass variation properties from the thrust curve
   - Define custom rocket tanks based on flux data
   - Support for CSV and ENG file formats

6. **Monte Carlo Simulations**
   - Conduct dispersion analysis and global sensitivity analysis

7. **Flexible and Modular**
   - Perform straightforward engineering analysis (e.g., apogee and lift-off speed as a function of mass)
   - Handle non-standard flights (e.g., parachute drop test from a helicopter)
   - Support multi-stage rockets and custom continuous/discrete control laws
   - Easily create new classes, such as other types of motors

8. **Integration with MATLAB®**
   - Effortlessly run RocketPy from MATLAB®
   - Convert RocketPy results to MATLAB® variables for further processing

These powerful features make RocketPy an indispensable tool for high-power rocket trajectory simulation, catering to enthusiasts, researchers, and engineers in the field of rocketry.

# Previewing

You can preview RocketPy's main functionalities by browsing through a sample notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/RocketPy-Team/rocketpy/blob/master/docs/notebooks/getting_started_colab.ipynb). No installation is required!

When you are ready to run RocketPy locally, you can read the *Getting Started* section!

<br>

# Getting Started

## Quick Installation

To install RocketPy's latest stable version from PyPI, just open up your terminal and run:

```shell
pip install rocketpy
```

For other installation options, visit our [Installation Docs](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/installation.html).
To learn more about RocketPy's requirements, visit our [Requirements Docs](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/requirements.html).

## Running Your First Simulation

In order to run your first rocket trajectory simulation using RocketPy, you can start a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the `docs/notebooks` folder. Open `getting_started.ipynb` and you are ready to go. We recommend that you read the [First Simulation](https://docs.rocketpy.org/en/latest/user/first_simulation.html) page to get a complete description.

Otherwise, you may want to create your own script or your own notebook using RocketPy. To do this, let's see how to use RocketPy's four main classes:

- `Environment` - Keeps data related to weather.
- `Motor` - Subdivided into `SolidMotor`, `HybridMotor` and `LiquidMotor`. Keeps data related to rocket motors.
- `Rocket` - Keeps data related to a rocket.
- `Flight` - Runs the simulation and keeps the results.

The following image shows how the four main classes interact with each other:

![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RocketPy-Team/RocketPy/master/docs/static/Fluxogram-Page-2.svg)

A typical workflow starts with importing these classes from RocketPy:

```python
from rocketpy import Environment, Rocket, SolidMotor, Flight
```

An optional step is to import datetime, which is used to define the date of the simulation:

```python
import datetime
```

Then create an Environment object. To learn more about it, you can use:

```python
help(Environment)
```

A sample code is:

```python
env = Environment(
    latitude=32.990254,
    longitude=-106.974998,
    elevation=1400,
)

tomorrow = datetime.date.today() + datetime.timedelta(days=1)

env.set_date(
  (tomorrow.year, tomorrow.month, tomorrow.day, 12), timezone="America/Denver"
) # Tomorrow's date in year, month, day, hour UTC format

env.set_atmospheric_model(type='Forecast', file='GFS')
```

This can be followed up by starting a Solid Motor object. To get help on it, just use:

```python
help(SolidMotor)
```

A sample Motor object can be created by the following code:

```python
Pro75M1670 = SolidMotor(
    thrust_source="data/motors/cesaroni/Cesaroni_M1670.eng",
    dry_mass=1.815,
    dry_inertia=(0.125, 0.125, 0.002),
    center_of_dry_mass_position=0.317,
    grains_center_of_mass_position=0.397,
    burn_time=3.9,
    grain_number=5,
    grain_separation=0.005,
    grain_density=1815,
    grain_outer_radius=0.033,
    grain_initial_inner_radius=0.015,
    grain_initial_height=0.12,
    nozzle_radius=0.033,
    throat_radius=0.011,
    interpolation_method="linear",
    nozzle_position=0,
    coordinate_system_orientation="nozzle_to_combustion_chamber",
)
```

With a Solid Motor defined, you are ready to create your Rocket object. As you may have guessed, to get help on it, use:

```python
help(Rocket)
```

A sample code to create a Rocket is:

```python
calisto = Rocket(
    radius=0.0635,
    mass=14.426,  # without motor
    inertia=(6.321, 6.321, 0.034),
    power_off_drag="data/rockets/calisto/powerOffDragCurve.csv",
    power_on_drag="data/rockets/calisto/powerOnDragCurve.csv",
    center_of_mass_without_motor=0,
    coordinate_system_orientation="tail_to_nose",
)

buttons = calisto.set_rail_buttons(
    upper_button_position=0.0818,
    lower_button_position=-0.6182,
    angular_position=45,
)

calisto.add_motor(Pro75M1670, position=-1.255)

nose = calisto.add_nose(
    length=0.55829, kind="vonKarman", position=1.278
)

fins = calisto.add_trapezoidal_fins(
    n=4,
    root_chord=0.120,
    tip_chord=0.040,
    span=0.100,
    sweep_length=None,
    cant_angle=0,
    position=-1.04956,
)

tail = calisto.add_tail(
    top_radius=0.0635, bottom_radius=0.0435, length=0.060, position=-1.194656
)
```

You may want to add parachutes to your rocket as well:

```python
main = calisto.add_parachute(
    name="main",
    cd_s=10.0,
    trigger=800,  # ejection altitude in meters
    sampling_rate=105,
    lag=1.5,
    noise=(0, 8.3, 0.5),
)

drogue = calisto.add_parachute(
    name="drogue",
    cd_s=1.0,
    trigger="apogee",  # ejection at apogee
    sampling_rate=105,
    lag=1.5,
    noise=(0, 8.3, 0.5),
)
```

Finally, you can create a Flight object to simulate your trajectory. To get help on the Flight class, use:

```python
help(Flight)
```

To actually create a Flight object, use:

```python
test_flight = Flight(
  rocket=calisto, environment=env, rail_length=5.2, inclination=85, heading=0
)
```

Once the Flight object is created, your simulation is done! Use the following code to get a summary of the results:

```python
test_flight.info()
```

To see all available results, use:

```python
test_flight.all_info()
```

Here is just a quick taste of what RocketPy is able to calculate. There are hundreds of plots and data points computed by RocketPy to enhance your analyses.

If you want to see the trajectory on Google Earth, RocketPy acn easily export a KML file for you:

```python
test_flight.export_kml(file_name="test_flight.kml")
```
