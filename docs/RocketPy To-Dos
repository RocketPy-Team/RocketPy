- RocketPy could automatically support different types of inputs on the dispersion errors. 
For Example, inserting an error value directly or just a percentage.

- RocketPy could be implemented on Julia. This language naturally supports Metaprogramming

- The Fin optimization could consider the number of fins as a variable and find the best compromise between size, mass, 
drag, quantity and lift of the fins, considering that less fins will generate less Drag, but they also need to be bigger 
to generate the same lift as a higher fin quantity.

- RocketPy could simulate different rocket profiles, eg. hexagonal, squared etc.. since these non circular profiles 
will generate lift.

- RocketPy could have an optimization in which given data such as trajectory and apogee, 
it returns adjustable parameters of the rocket and launchpad ex.: mass, center of mass, rail angle etc.
