Earth Models
============

The ``Environment`` class in RocketPy currently supports only a flat Earth model.
This means that you cannot set up an environment with a spherical Earth model or
more complex shapes.

However, you can still set up a flat Earth model with gravity varying with altitude
and a topography profile varying with the horizontal distance.
