        data as costum functions, arrays or csv files.

        Parameters
        ----------
        type : string
            One of the following options:
            - 'StandardAtmosphere': sets pressure and temperature
            profiles corresponding to the International Standard
            Atmosphere defined by ISO 2533 and ranging from -2 km
            to 80 km of altitude above sea level. Note that the wind
            profiles are set to zero when this type is chosen.

            - 'WyomingSounding': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u
            and wind-v profiles and surface elevation obtained from
            an upper air sounding given by the file parameter through
            an URL. This URL should point to a data webpage given by
            selecting plot type as text: list, a station and a time at
            http://weather.uwyo.edu/upperair/sounding.html.
            An example of a valid link would be:
            http://weather.uwyo.edu/cgi-bin/sounding?region=samer&TYPE=TEXT%3ALIST&YEAR=2019&MONTH=02&FROM=0200&TO=0200&STNM=82599

            - 'NOAARucSounding': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u
            and wind-v profiles and surface elevation obtained from
            an upper air sounding given by the file parameter through
            an URL. This URL should point to a data webpage obtained
            through NOAA's Ruc Sounding servers, which can be accessed
            in https://rucsoundings.noaa.gov/. Selecting ROABs as the
            initial data source, specifying the station through it's
            WMO-ID and opting for the ASCII (GSD format) button, the
            following example URL opens up: https://rucsoundings.noaa.gov/get_raobs.cgi?data_source=RAOB&latest=latest&start_year=2019&start_month_name=Feb&start_mday=5&start_hour=12&start_min=0&n_hrs=1.0&fcst_len=shortest&airport=83779&text=Ascii%20text%20%28GSD%20format%29&hydrometeors=false&start=latest
            Any ASCII GSD format page from this server can be read,
            so information from virtual soundings such as GFS and NAM
            can also be imported.

            - 'Forecast': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u and wind-v
            profiles and surface elevation obtained from a weather
            forecast file in netCDF format or from an OPeNDAP URL, both
            given through the file parameter. When this type
            is chosen, the date and location of the launch
            should already have been set through the date and
            location parameters when initializing the Environment.
            The netCDF and OPeNDAP datasets must contain at least
            geopotential height or geopotential, temperature,
            wind-u and wind-v profiles as a function of pressure levels.
            If surface geopotential or geopotential height is given,
            elevation is also set. Otherwise, elevation is not changed.
            Profiles are interpolated bi-linearly using supplied
            latitude and longitude. The date used is the nearest one
            to the date supplied. Furthermore, a dictionary must be
            supplied through the dictionary parameter in order for the
            dataset to be accurately read. Lastly, the dataset must use
            a rectangular grid sorted in either ascending or descending
            order of latitude and longitude.

            - 'Reanalysis': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u and wind-v
            profiles and surface elevation obtained from a weather
            forecast file in netCDF format or from an OPeNDAP URL, both
            given through the file parameter. When this type
            is chosen, the date and location of the launch
            should already have been set through the date and
            location parameters when initializing the Environment.
            The netCDF and OPeNDAP datasets must contain at least
            geopotential height or geopotential, temperature,
            wind-u and wind-v profiles as a function of pressure levels.
            If surface geopotential or geopotential height is given,
            elevation is also set. Otherwise, elevation is not changed.
            Profiles are interpolated bi-linearly using supplied
            latitude and longitude. The date used is the nearest one
            to the date supplied. Furthermore, a dictionary must be
            supplied through the dictionary parameter in order for the
            dataset to be accurately read. Lastly, the dataset must use
            a rectangular grid sorted in either ascending or descending
            order of latitude and longitude.

            - 'Ensemble': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u and wind-v
            profiles and surface elevation obtained from a weather
            forecast file in netCDF format or from an OPeNDAP URL, both
            given through the file parameter. When this type
            is chosen, the date and location of the launch
            should already have been set through the date and
            location parameters when initializing the Environment.
            The netCDF and OPeNDAP datasets must contain at least
            geopotential height or geopotential, temperature,
            wind-u and wind-v profiles as a function of pressure
            levels. If surface geopotential or geopotential height
            is given, elevation is also set. Otherwise, elevation is not
            changed. Profiles are interpolated bi-linearly using supplied
            latitude and longitude. The date used is the nearest one
            to the date supplied. Furthermore, a dictionary must be
            supplied through the dictionary parameter in order for the
            dataset to be accurately read. Lastly, the dataset must use
            a rectangular grid sorted in either ascending or descending
            order of latitude and longitude. By default the first ensemble
            forecast is activated. To activate other ensemble forecasts
            see Environment.selectEnsembleMemberMember().

            - 'CustomAtmosphere': sets pressure, temperature, wind-u
            and wind-v profiles given though the pressure, temperature,
            wind-u and wind-v parameters of this method. If pressure
            or temperature is not given, it will default to the
            International Standard Atmosphere. If the wind components
            are not given, it will default to 0.
        file : string, optional
            String that must be given when type is either
            'WyomingSounding', 'Forecast', 'Reanalysis' or 'Ensemble'.
            It specifies the location of the data given, either through
            a local file adress or a URL.
            If type is 'Forecast', this parameter can also be either
            'GFS', 'FV3', 'RAP' or 'NAM' for latest of these forecasts.
            References: GFS: Global - 0.25deg resolution - Updates every 6 hours, forecast for 81 points spaced by 3 hours
                        FV3: Global - 0.25deg resolution - Updates every 6 hours, forecast for 129 points spaced by 3 hours

        dictionary : dictionary, string, optional
            Dictionary that must be given when type is either
            'Forecast', 'Reanalysis' or 'Ensemble'.
            It specifies the dictionary to be used when reading netCDF

            Acceptable values include 'ECMWF', 'NOAA' and 'UCAR' for
            default dicitonaries which can generally be used to read
            datasets from these institutes.
            Alternatively, a dictionary structure can also be given,
            specifying the short names used for time, latitude, longitude,
            pressure levels, temperature profile, geopotential or
            geopotential height profile, wind-u and wind-v profiles in

            If a string is given, it should point to a .CSV file
            containing at most one header line and two columns of data.
            The first column must be the geometric height above sea level in
            meters while the second column must be the wind-v in m/s.
            If an array is given, it is expected to be an array of
            coordinates (height in meters, wind-v in m/s).
            Finally, a callable or function is also acepted. The
            function should take one argument, the height above sea
            level in meters and return a corresponding wind-v in m/s.

    def processForecastReanalysis(self, file, dictionary):
        """Import and process atmospheric data from weather forecasts
        and reanalysis given as netCDF or OPeNDAP files.
        Sets pressure, temperature, wind-u and wind-v
        profiles and surface elevation obtained from a weather
        file in netCDF format or from an OPeNDAP URL, both
        given through the file parameter. The date and location of the launch
        should already have been set through the date and
        location parameters when initializing the Environment.
        The netCDF and OPeNDAP datasets must contain at least
        geopotential height or geopotential, temperature,
        wind-u and wind-v profiles as a function of pressure levels.
        If surface geopotential or geopotential height is given,
        elevation is also set. Otherwise, elevation is not changed.
        Profiles are interpolated bi-linearly using supplied
        latitude and longitude. The date used is the nearest one
        to the date supplied. Furthermore, a dictionary must be
        supplied through the dictionary parameter in order for the
        dataset to be accurately read. Lastly, the dataset must use
        a rectangular grid sorted in either ascending or descending
        order of latitude and longitude.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : string
            String containing path to local netCDF file or URL of an
            OPeNDAP file, such as NOAA's NOMAD or UCAR TRHEDDS server.
        dicitonary : dictionary
            Specifies the dictionary to be used when reading netCDF and
            OPeNDAP files, allowing for the correct retrieval of data.
            The dictionary structure should specify the short names
            used for time, latitude, longitude, pressure levels,
            temperature profile, geopotential or geopotential height
            profile, wind-u and wind-v profiles in the dataset given in
            the file parameter. An example is the following dicitonary,
            generally used to read OPeNDAP files from NOAA's NOMAD
            server:               {'time': 'time',
                               'latitude': 'lat',
                              'longitude': 'lon',
                                  'level': 'lev',
                            'temperature': 'tmpprs',

    def processEnsemble(self, file, dictionary):
        """Import and process atmospheric data from weather ensembles
        given as netCDF or OPeNDAP files.
        Sets pressure, temperature, wind-u and wind-v
        profiles and surface elevation obtained from a weather
        ensemble file in netCDF format or from an OPeNDAP URL, both
        given through the file parameter. The date and location of the launch
        should already have been set through the date and
        location parameters when initializing the Environment.
        The netCDF and OPeNDAP datasets must contain at least
        geopotential height or geopotential, temperature,
        wind-u and wind-v profiles as a function of pressure
        levels. If surface geopotential or geopotential height
        is given, elevation is also set. Otherwise, elevation is not
        changed. Profiles are interpolated bi-linearly using supplied
        latitude and longitude. The date used is the nearest one
        to the date supplied. Furthermore, a dictionary must be
        supplied through the dictionary parameter in order for the
        dataset to be accurately read. Lastly, the dataset must use
        a rectangular grid sorted in either ascending or descending
        order of latitude and longitude. By default the first ensemble
        forecast is activated. To activate other ensemble forecasts
        see Environment.selectEnsembleMemberMember().

        Parameters
        ----------
        file : string
            String containing path to local netCDF file or URL of an
            OPeNDAP file, such as NOAA's NOMAD or UCAR TRHEDDS server.
        dicitonary : dictionary
            Specifies the dictionary to be used when reading netCDF and
            OPeNDAP files, allowing for the correct retrieval of data.
            The dictionary structure should specify the short names
            used for time, latitude, longitude, pressure levels,
            temperature profile, geopotential or geopotential height
            profile, wind-u and wind-v profiles in the dataset given in
            the file parameter. An example is the following dicitonary,
            generally used to read OPeNDAP files from NOAA's NOMAD
            server:               {'time': 'time',
                               'latitude': 'lat',
                              'longitude': 'lon',
