                Parachute name, such as drogue and main. Has no impact in
                simulation, as it is only used to display data in a more
                organized matter.

                force is the dynamic pressure computed on the parachute
                times its CdS coefficient. Has units of area and must be

                to be triggered and False otherwise.
            samplingRate : float, optional
                Sampling rate in which the trigger function works. It is used to
                simulate the refresh rate of onboard sensors such as barometers.

                Time between the parachute ejection system is triggered and the
                parachute is fully opened. During this time, the simulation will
                consider the rocket as flying without a parachute. Default value
                is 0. Must be given in seconds.
            noise : tuple, list, optional
                List in the format (mean, standard deviation, time-correlation).
                The values are used to add noise to the pressure signal which is
                passed to the trigger function. Default value is (0, 0, 0). Units
                are in pascal.
            noiseSignal : list
                List of (t, noise signal) corresponding to signal passed to
                trigger function. Completed after running a simulation.

            Default value is 100. Value must be given in hertz.

            Time between the parachute ejection system is triggered and the
