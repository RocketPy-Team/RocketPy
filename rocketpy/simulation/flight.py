            Rocket to simulate.
        environment : Environment
            Environment to run simulation on.
        rail_length : int, float
            Length in which the rocket will be attached to the rail, only
            moving along a fixed direction, that is, the line parallel to the
            rail. Currently, if the an initial_solution is passed, the rail
            length is not used.
        inclination : int, float, optional
            Rail inclination angle relative to ground, given in degrees.
            Default is 80.
        heading : int, float, optional
            Heading angle relative to north given in degrees.
            Default is 90, which points in the x (east) direction.
        initial_solution : array, Flight, optional
            Initial solution array to be used. Format is:

            .. code-block:: python

                initial_solution = [
                    self.t_initial,
                    x_init, y_init, z_init,
                    vx_init, vy_init, vz_init,
                    e0_init, e1_init, e2_init, e3_init,
                    w1_init, w2_init, w3_init
                ]

            If a Flight object is used, the last state vector will be
            used as initial solution. If None, the initial solution will start
            with all null values, except for the euler parameters which will be
            calculated based on given values of inclination and heading.
            Default is None.
        terminate_on_apogee : boolean, optional
            Whether to terminate simulation when rocket reaches apogee.
            Default is False.
        max_time : int, float, optional
            Maximum time in which to simulate trajectory in seconds.
            Using this without setting a max_time_step may cause unexpected
            errors. Default is 600.
        max_time_step : int, float, optional
            Maximum time step to use during integration in seconds.
            Default is 0.01.
        min_time_step : int, float, optional
            Minimum time step to use during integration in seconds.
            Default is 0.01.
        rtol : float, array, optional
            Maximum relative error tolerance to be tolerated in the
            integration scheme. Can be given as array for each
            state space variable. Default is 1e-3.
        atol : float, optional
            Maximum absolute error tolerance to be tolerated in the
            integration scheme. Can be given as array for each
            state space variable. Default is 6*[1e-3] + 4*[1e-6] + 3*[1e-3].
        time_overshoot : bool, optional
            If True, decouples ODE time step from parachute trigger functions
            sampling rate. The time steps can overshoot the necessary trigger
            function evaluation points and then interpolation is used to
            calculate them and feed the triggers. Can greatly improve run
            time in some cases. Default is True.
        verbose : bool, optional
            If true, verbose mode is activated. Default is False.
        name : str, optional
            Name of the flight. Default is "Flight".
        equations_of_motion : str, optional
            Type of equations of motion to use. Can be "standard" or
            "solid_propulsion". Default is "standard". Solid propulsion is a
            more restricted set of equations of motion that only works for
            solid propulsion rockets. Such equations were used in RocketPy v0
            and are kept here for backwards compatibility.
        ode_solver : str, ``scipy.integrate.OdeSolver``, optional
            Integration method to use to solve the equations of motion ODE.
            Available options are: 'RK23', 'RK45', 'DOP853', 'Radau', 'BDF',
            'LSODA' from ``scipy.integrate.solve_ivp``.
            Default is 'LSODA', which is recommended for most flights.
            A custom ``scipy.integrate.OdeSolver`` can be passed as well.
            For more information on the integration methods, see the scipy
            documentation [1]_.
