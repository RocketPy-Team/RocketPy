        Parameters
        ----------
        interactive_objects : list or object
            A collection of objects that the controller function can access and
            potentially modify. This can be either a list of objects or a single
            object. The objects listed here are provided to the controller function
            as the last argument, maintaining the order specified in this list if
            it's a list. The controller function gains the ability to interact with
            and make adjustments to these objects during its execution.
        controller_function : function, callable
            An user-defined function responsible for controlling the simulation.
            This function is expected to take the following arguments, in order:

            1. `time` (float): The current simulation time in seconds.
            2. `sampling_rate` (float): The rate at which the controller
               function is called, measured in Hertz (Hz).
            3. `state` (list): The state vector of the simulation, structured as
               `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, e0, e1, e2, e3, wx, wy, wz]`.
            4. `state_history` (list): A record of the rocket's state at each
               step throughout the simulation. The state_history is organized as
               a list of lists, with each sublist containing a state vector. The
               last item in the list always corresponds to the previous state
               vector, providing a chronological sequence of the rocket's
               evolving states.
            5. `observed_variables` (list): A list containing the variables that
               the controller function returns. The return of each controller
               function call is appended to the observed_variables list. The
               initial value in the first step of the simulation of this list is
               provided by the `initial_observed_variables` argument.
            6. `interactive_objects` (list): A list containing the objects that
               the controller function can interact with. The objects are
               listed in the same order as they are provided in the
               `interactive_objects`.
            7. `sensors` (list): A list of sensors that are attached to the
                rocket. The most recent measurements of the sensors are provided
                with the ``sensor.measurement`` attribute. The sensors are
                listed in the same order as they are added to the rocket

            This function will be called during the simulation at the specified
            sampling rate. The function should evaluate and change the interactive
            objects as needed. The function return statement can be used to save
            relevant information in the `observed_variables` list.

            .. note:: The function will be called according to the sampling rate
            specified.
        sampling_rate : float
            The sampling rate of the controller function in Hertz (Hz). This
            means that the controller function will be called every
            `1/sampling_rate` seconds.
        initial_observed_variables : list, optional
            A list of the initial values of the variables that the controller
            function returns. This list is used to initialize the
            `observed_variables` argument of the controller function. The
            default value is None, which initializes the list as an empty list.
        name : str
            The name of the controller. This will be used for printing and
            plotting.
