        is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the
        coordinate system may be placed anywhere along such axis, such as
        at the nozzle exit area, and must be kept the same for all other
        positions specified. Options are "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber" and

        thrust_source : int, float, callable, string, array, Function
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file can contain a single line header and the first column
            must specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies
            thrust. Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the
            class Function. Thrust units are Newtons.

            .. seealso:: :doc:`Thrust Source Details </user/motors/thrust>`

        dry_mass : int, float
            Same as in Motor class. See the :class:`Motor <rocketpy.Motor>` docs
        center_of_dry_mass_position : int, float
            The position, in meters, of the motor's center of mass with respect
            to the motor's coordinate system when it is devoid of propellant.
            See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
        dry_inertia : tuple, list
            Tuple or list containing the motor's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2. This inertia is defined with respect to the
            the `center_of_dry_mass_position` position.
            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as
            (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.
        nozzle_radius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet radius in meters.
        burn_time: float, tuple of float, optional
            Motor's burn time.
            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and
            the given float, in seconds.
            If a tuple of float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between
            the first and second elements of the tuple, in seconds.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the range between the
            first and last-time step of the motor's thrust curve. This can only
            be used if the motor's thrust is defined by a list of points, such
            as a .csv file, a .eng file or a Function instance whose source is a
            list.
        nozzle_position : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet position in meters, in the motor's coordinate
            system. See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
            for details. Default is 0, in which case the origin of the
            coordinate system is placed at the motor's nozzle outlet.
        reshape_thrust_curve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False. Note that the Motor burn_time parameter must include the new
            reshaped burn time.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
        coordinate_system_orientation : string, optional
            Orientation of the motor's coordinate system. The coordinate system
            is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the

        Notes
        -----
        This function computes the total mass flow rate of the motor by
        dividing the thrust data by the exhaust velocity. This is an
        approximation, and it  is used by the child Motor classes as follows:

        - The ``SolidMotor`` class uses this approximation to compute the
          grain's mass flow rate;
        - The ``HybridMotor`` class uses this approximation as a reference
          to the sum of the oxidizer and fuel (grains) mass flow rates;
        - The ``LiquidMotor`` class favors the more accurate data from the
          Tanks's mass flow rates. Therefore this value is numerically
          independent of the ``LiquidMotor.mass_flow_rate``.
        - The ``GenericMotor`` class considers the total_mass_flow_rate as the
        same as the mass_flow_rate.

        It should be noted that, for hybrid motors, the oxidizer mass flow
        rate should not be greater than `total_mass_flow_rate`, otherwise the
        grains mass flow rate will be negative, losing physical meaning.

        Parameters
        ----------
        thrust_source : int, float, callable, string, array, Function
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file can contain a single line header and the first column must
            specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies thrust.
            Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the class
            Function. Thrust units are Newtons.

            .. seealso:: :doc:`Thrust Source Details </user/motors/thrust>`

        chamber_radius : int, float
            The radius of a overall cylindrical chamber of propellant in meters.
            This is a rough estimate for the motor's propellant chamber or tanks.
        chamber_height : int, float
            The height of a overall cylindrical chamber of propellant in meters.
            This is a rough estimate for the motor's propellant chamber or tanks.
        chamber_position : int, float
            The position, in meters, of the centroid (half height) of the motor's
            overall cylindrical chamber of propellant with respect to the motor's
            coordinate system.
            See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
        dry_mass : int, float
            Same as in Motor class. See the :class:`Motor <rocketpy.Motor>` docs
        propellant_initial_mass : int, float
            The initial mass of the propellant in the motor.
        center_of_dry_mass_position : int, float, optional
            The position, in meters, of the motor's center of mass with respect
            to the motor's coordinate system when it is devoid of propellant.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the chamber position.
            See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
        dry_inertia : tuple, list
            Tuple or list containing the motor's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2. This inertia is defined with respect to the
            the `center_of_dry_mass_position` position.
            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as
            (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.
        nozzle_radius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet radius in meters.
        burn_time: float, tuple of float, optional
            Motor's burn time.
            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and
            the given float, in seconds.
            If a tuple of float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between
            the first and second elements of the tuple, in seconds.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the range between the
            first and last-time step of the motor's thrust curve. This can only
            be used if the motor's thrust is defined by a list of points, such
            as a .csv file, a .eng file or a Function instance whose source is a
            list.
        nozzle_position : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet position in meters, in the motor's coordinate
            system. See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
            for details. Default is 0, in which case the origin of the
            coordinate system is placed at the motor's nozzle outlet.
        reshape_thrust_curve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False. Note that the Motor burn_time parameter must include the new
            reshaped burn time.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
        coordinate_system_orientation : string, optional
            Orientation of the motor's coordinate system. The coordinate system
            is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the
            coordinate system may be placed anywhere along such axis, such as
            at the nozzle area, and must be kept the same for all other
            positions specified. Options are "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber" and
            "combustion_chamber_to_nozzle". Default is
            "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber".
