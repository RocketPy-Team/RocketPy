class TankGeometry:
    """Class to define the geometry of a tank. It is used to calculate the
    geometrical properties such as volume, area and radius. The tank is
    axi-symmetric, and its geometry is defined by a set of Functions that
    are used to calculate the radius as a function of height.

    Attributes
    ----------
    TankGeometry.geometry : dict
        Dictionary containing the geometry of the tank. The dictionary
        keys are disjoint domains of the corresponding coordinates in
        meters on the TankGeometry symmetry axis. The dictionary values
        are rocketpy.Function objects that map the Tank height to its
        corresponding radius.
        As an example, `{ (-1,1): Function(lambda h: (1 - h**2) ** (1/2)) }`
        defines an spherical tank of radius 1.
    TankGeometry.radius : Function
        Piecewise defined radius in meters as a rocketpy.Function based
        on the TankGeometry.geometry dict.
    TankGeometry.average_radius : float
        The average radius in meters of the Tank radius. It is calculated
        as the average of the radius Function over the tank height.
    TankGeometry.bottom : float
        The bottom of the tank. It is the lowest coordinate that belongs to
        the domain of the geometry.
    TankGeometry.top : float
        The top of the tank. It is the highest coordinate that belongs to
        the domain of the geometry.
    TankGeometry.total_height : float
        The total height of the tank, in meters. It is calculated as the
        difference between the top and bottom coordinates.
    TankGeometry.area : Function
        Tank cross sectional area in meters squared as a function of height,
        defined as the area of a circle with radius TankGeometry.radius.
    TankGeometry.volume : Function
        Tank volume in in meters cubed as a function of height, defined as
        the Tank volume from the bottom to the given height.
    TankGeometry.total_volume : float
        Total volume of the tank, in meters cubed. It is calculated as the
        volume from the bottom to the top of the tank.
    TankGeometry.inverse_volume : Function
        Tank height as a function of volume, defined as the inverse of the
        TankGeometry.volume Function.
