        thrust_source : int, float, callable, string, array, Function
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in

            The .csv file can contain a single line header and the first column
            must specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies

            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as
            (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.

            more information.

            The position, in meters, of the motor's center of mass with respect

            coordinate system is placed at the motor's nozzle outlet.
        burn_time: float, tuple of float, optional
            Motor's burn time.
            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and

            If a tuple of float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between
            the first and second elements of the tuple, in seconds.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the range between the
            first and last-time step of the motor's thrust curve. This can only
            be used if the motor's thrust is defined by a list of points, such
            as a .csv file, a .eng file or a Function instance whose source is
            a list.
        throat_radius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle throat radius in meters. Used to calculate Kn curve.

            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
        coordinate_system_orientation : string, optional
            Orientation of the motor's coordinate system. The coordinate system
            is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the

            at the nozzle area, and must be kept the same for all other
            positions specified. Options are "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber" and
