            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file can contain a single line header and the first column
            must specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies
            thrust. Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the
            class Function. Thrust units are Newtons.

        dry_mass : int, float
            Same as in Motor class. See the :class:`Motor <rocketpy.Motor>` docs.
        dry_inertia : tuple, list
            Tuple or list containing the motor's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2. This inertia is defined with respect to the
            the ``center_of_dry_mass_position`` position.
            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.

            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and
            the given float, in seconds.
            If a tuple of float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between
            the first and second elements of the tuple, in seconds.
            If not specified, automatically sourced as the range between the
            first and last-time step of the motor's thrust curve. This can only
            be used if the motor's thrust is defined by a list of points, such
            as a .csv file, a .eng file or a Function instance whose source is
            a list.
        reshape_thrust_curve : boolean, tuple, optional

            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
