        Parameters
        ----------
        thrust_source : int, float, callable, string, array, Function
            Motor's thrust curve. Can be given as an int or float, in which
            case the thrust will be considered constant in time. It can
            also be given as a callable function, whose argument is time in
            seconds and returns the thrust supplied by the motor in the
            instant. If a string is given, it must point to a .csv or .eng file.
            The .csv file can contain a single line header and the first column
            must specify time in seconds, while the second column specifies
            thrust. Arrays may also be specified, following rules set by the
            class Function. Thrust units are Newtons.

            Tuple or list containing the motor's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2. This inertia is defined with respect to the

            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as
            (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.

            specifically, the coordinate of the center of mass specified in the
            motor's coordinate system.
            See
            :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`
            for more information.
        center_of_dry_mass_position : int, float
            The position, in meters, of the motor's center of mass with respect
            to the motor's coordinate system when it is devoid of propellant.
            See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`.
        nozzle_position : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle outlet position in meters, in the motor's coordinate
            system. See :doc:`Positions and Coordinate Systems </user/positions>`

            coordinate system is placed at the motor's nozzle outlet.
        burn_time: float, tuple of float, optional
            Motor's burn time.
            If a float is given, the burn time is assumed to be between 0 and
            the given float, in seconds. If a tuple of float is given, the burn
            time is assumed to be between the first and second elements of the
            tuple, in seconds. If not specified, automatically sourced as the
            range between the first- and last-time step of the motor's thrust
            curve. This can only be used if the motor's thrust is defined by a
            list of points, such as a .csv file, a .eng file or a Function
            instance whose source is a list.
        throat_radius : int, float, optional
            Motor's nozzle throat radius in meters. Used to calculate Kn curve.
            Optional if the Kn curve is not interesting. Its value does not
            impact trajectory simulation.
        reshape_thrust_curve : boolean, tuple, optional
            If False, the original thrust curve supplied is not altered. If a
            tuple is given, whose first parameter is a new burn out time and
            whose second parameter is a new total impulse in Ns, the thrust
            curve is reshaped to match the new specifications. May be useful
            for motors whose thrust curve shape is expected to remain similar
            in case the impulse and burn time varies slightly. Default is
            False.
        interpolation_method : string, optional
            Method of interpolation to be used in case thrust curve is given
            by data set in .csv or .eng, or as an array. Options are 'spline'
            'akima' and 'linear'. Default is "linear".
        coordinate_system_orientation : string, optional
            Orientation of the motor's coordinate system. The coordinate system
            is defined by the motor's axis of symmetry. The origin of the
            coordinate system may be placed anywhere along such axis, such as
            at the nozzle area, and must be kept the same for all other
            positions specified. Options are "nozzle_to_combustion_chamber" and
