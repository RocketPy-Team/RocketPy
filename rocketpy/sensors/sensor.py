        ----------
        sampling_rate : float

        orientation : tuple, list, optional
            Orientation of the sensor in relation to the rocket frame of
            reference (Body Axes Coordinate System). See :ref:`rocket_axes` for
            more information.
            If orientation is not given, the sensor axes will be aligned with
            the rocket axis.
            The orientation can be given as either:

            - A list or tuple of length 3, where the elements are the intrinsic
              rotation angles in radians. The rotation sequence z-x-z (3-1-3) is
              used, meaning the sensor is first around the z axis (roll), then
              around the new x axis (pitch) and finally around the new z axis
              (roll).
            - A list of lists (matrix) of shape 3x3, representing the rotation
              matrix from the sensor frame to the rocket frame. The sensor frame
              of reference is defined as being initially aligned with the rocket
              frame of reference.
        measurement_range : float, tuple, optional
            The measurement range of the sensor in the sensor units. If a float,

            is the negative range. Default is np.inf.
        resolution : float, optional
            The resolution of the sensor in sensor units/LSB. Default is 0,
            meaning no quantization is applied.
        noise_density : float, list, optional
            The noise density of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in sensor
            units/√Hz. Sometimes called "white noise drift",
            "angular random walk" for gyroscopes, "velocity random walk" for
            accelerometers or "(rate) noise density". Default is 0, meaning no
            noise is applied. If a float or int is given, the same noise density
            is applied to all axes. The values of each axis can be set
            individually by passing a list of length 3.
        noise_variance : float, list, optional
            The noise variance of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in
            sensor units^2. Default is 1, meaning the noise is normally
            distributed with a standard deviation of 1 unit. If a float or int
            is given, the same noise variance is applied to all axes. The values

        random_walk_density : float, list, optional
            The random walk density of the sensor for a Gaussian random walk in
            sensor units/√Hz. Sometimes called "bias (in)stability" or
            "bias drift". Default is 0, meaning no random walk is applied.
            If a float or int is given, the same random walk is applied to all
            axes. The values of each axis can be set individually by passing a
            list of length 3.
        random_walk_variance : float, list, optional

            values of each axis can be set individually by passing a list of
            length 3.
        constant_bias : float, list, optional
            The constant bias of the sensor in sensor units. Default is 0,
            meaning no constant bias is applied. If a float or int is given, the
            same constant bias is applied to all axes. The values of each axis
            can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        operating_temperature : float, optional
            The operating temperature of the sensor in Kelvin.
            At 298.15 K (25 °C), the sensor is assumed to operate ideally, no
            temperature related noise is applied. Default is 298.15.
        temperature_bias : float, list, optional
            The temperature bias of the sensor in sensor units/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature bias is applied. If a float or int is given,

            axis can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        temperature_scale_factor : float, list, optional
            The temperature scale factor of the sensor in %/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature scale factor is applied. If a float or int is

            values of each axis can be set individually by passing a list of

        cross_axis_sensitivity : float, optional

            is the negative range. Default is np.inf.
        resolution : float, optional
            The resolution of the sensor in sensor units/LSB. Default is 0,
            meaning no quantization is applied.
        noise_density : float, list, optional
            The noise density of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in sensor
            units/√Hz. Sometimes called "white noise drift",

            The noise variance of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in
            sensor units^2. Default is 1, meaning the noise is normally

            The random walk density of the sensor for a Gaussian random walk in
            sensor units/√Hz. Sometimes called "bias (in)stability" or
            "bias drift". Default is 0, meaning no random walk is applied.
        random_walk_variance : float, list, optional
            The random walk variance of the sensor for a Gaussian random walk in
            sensor units^2. Default is 1, meaning the noise is normally
            distributed with a standard deviation of 1 unit.

            The constant bias of the sensor in sensor units. Default is 0,
            meaning no constant bias is applied.

            The operating temperature of the sensor in Kelvin.
            At 298.15 K (25 °C), the sensor is assumed to operate ideally, no
            temperature related noise is applied. Default is 298.15.
        temperature_bias : float, list, optional
            The temperature bias of the sensor in sensor units/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature bias is applied.
        temperature_scale_factor : float, list, optional
            The temperature scale factor of the sensor in %/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature scale factor is applied.
