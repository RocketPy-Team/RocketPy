        Parameters
        ----------
        sampling_rate : float
            Sample rate of the sensor in Hz.
        orientation : tuple, list, optional
            Orientation of the sensor in the rocket. The orientation can be
            given as:

            - A list of length 3, where the elements are the Euler angles for
              the rotation yaw (ψ), pitch (θ) and roll (φ) in radians. The
              standard rotation sequence is z-y-x (3-2-1) is used, meaning the
              sensor is first rotated by ψ around the x axis, then by θ around
              the new y axis and finally by φ around the new z axis.
            - A list of lists (matrix) of shape 3x3, representing the rotation
              matrix from the sensor frame to the rocket frame. The sensor frame
              of reference is defined as to have z axis along the sensor's normal
              vector pointing upwards, x and y axes perpendicular to the z axis
              and each other.

            The rocket frame of reference is defined as to have z axis
            along the rocket's axis of symmetry pointing upwards, x and y axes
            perpendicular to the z axis and each other. Default is (0, 0, 0),
            meaning the sensor is aligned with the rocket's axis of symmetry.
        measurement_range : float, tuple, optional
            The measurement range of the sensor in the rad/s. If a float, the
            same range is applied both for positive and negative values. If a
            tuple, the first value is the positive range and the second value is
            the negative range. Default is np.inf.
        resolution : float, optional
            The resolution of the sensor in rad/s/LSB. Default is 0, meaning no
            quantization is applied.
        noise_density : float, list, optional
            The noise density of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in rad/s/√Hz.
            Sometimes called "white noise drift", "angular random walk" for
            gyroscopes, "velocity random walk" for the accelerometers or
            "(rate) noise density". Default is 0, meaning no noise is applied.
            If a float or int is given, the same noise density is applied to all
            axes. The values of each axis can be set individually by passing a
            list of length 3.
        noise_variance : float, list, optional
            The noise variance of the sensor for a Gaussian white noise in (rad/s)^2.
            Default is 1, meaning the noise is normally distributed with a
            standard deviation of 1 rad/s. If a float or int is given, the same
            variance is applied to all axes. The values of each axis can be set
            individually by passing a list of length 3.
        random_walk_density : float, list, optional
            The random walk density of the sensor for a Gaussian random walk in
            rad/s/√Hz. Sometimes called "bias (in)stability" or "bias drift"".
            Default is 0, meaning no random walk is applied. If a float or int
            is given, the same random walk is applied to all axes. The values of
            each axis can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        random_walk_variance : float, list, optional
            The random walk variance of the sensor for a Gaussian random walk in
            (rad/s)^2. Default is 1, meaning the random walk is normally
            distributed with a standard deviation of 1 rad/s. If a float or int
            is given, the same variance is applied to all axes. The values of
            each axis can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        constant_bias : float, list, optional
            The constant bias of the sensor in rad/s. Default is 0, meaning no
            constant bias is applied. If a float or int is given, the same bias
            is applied to all axes. The values of each axis can be set
            individually by passing a list of length 3.
        operating_temperature : float, optional
            The operating temperature of the sensor in Kelvin.
            At 298.15 K (25 °C), the sensor is assumed to operate ideally, no
            temperature related noise is applied. Default is 298.15.
        temperature_sensitivity : float, list, optional
            The temperature bias of the sensor in rad/s/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature bias is applied. If a float or int is given,
            the same temperature bias is applied to all axes. The values of each
            axis can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        temperature_scale_factor : float, list, optional
            The temperature scale factor of the sensor in %/K. Default is 0,
            meaning no temperature scale factor is applied. If a float or int is
            given, the same temperature scale factor is applied to all axes. The
            values of each axis can be set individually by passing a list of
            length 3.
        cross_axis_sensitivity : float, optional
            Skewness of the sensor's axes in percentage. Default is 0, meaning
            no cross-axis sensitivity is applied.
            of each axis can be set individually by passing a list of length 3.
        acceleration_sensitivity : float, list, optional
            Sensitivity of the sensor to linear acceleration in rad/s/g. Default
            is 0, meaning no sensitivity to linear acceleration is applied. If a
            float or int is given, the same sensitivity is applied to all axes.
            The values of each axis can be set individually by passing a list of
            length 3.
