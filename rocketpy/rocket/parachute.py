class Parachute:
    """Keeps parachute information.

    Attributes
    ----------
    Parachute.name : string
        Parachute name, such as drogue and main. Has no impact in
        simulation, as it is only used to display data in a more
        organized matter.
    Parachute.cd_s : float
        Drag coefficient times reference area for parachute. It has units of
        area and must be given in squared meters.
    Parachute.trigger : callable, float, str
        This parameter defines the trigger condition for the parachute ejection
        system. It can be one of the following:

        - A callable function that takes three arguments:
        1. Freestream pressure in pascals.
        2. Height in meters above ground level.
        3. The state vector of the simulation, which is defined as:

           `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, e0, e1, e2, e3, wx, wy, wz]`.

        4. A list of sensors that are attached to the rocket. The most recent
           measurements of the sensors are provided with the
           ``sensor.measurement`` attribute. The sensors are listed in the same
           order as they are added to the rocket.

        The function should return ``True`` if the parachute ejection system
        should be triggered and False otherwise. The function will be called
        according to the specified sampling rate.

        - A float value, representing an absolute height in meters. In this
        case, the parachute will be ejected when the rocket reaches this height
        above ground level.

        - The string "apogee" which triggers the parachute at apogee, i.e.,
        when the rocket reaches its highest point and starts descending.


    Parachute.triggerfunc : function
        Trigger function created from the trigger used to evaluate the trigger
        condition for the parachute ejection system. It is a callable function
        that takes three arguments: Freestream pressure in Pa, Height above
        ground level in meters, and the state vector of the simulation. The
        returns ``True`` if the parachute ejection system should be triggered
        and ``False`` otherwise.

        .. note:

            The function will be called according to the sampling rate specified.

    Parachute.sampling_rate : float
        Sampling rate, in Hz, for the trigger function.
    Parachute.lag : float
        Time, in seconds, between the parachute ejection system is triggered
        and the parachute is fully opened.
    Parachute.noise : tuple, list
        List in the format (mean, standard deviation, time-correlation).
        The values are used to add noise to the pressure signal which is passed
        to the trigger function. Default value is (0, 0, 0). Units are in Pa.
    Parachute.noise_bias : float
        Mean value of the noise added to the pressure signal, which is
        passed to the trigger function. Unit is in Pa.
    Parachute.noise_deviation : float
        Standard deviation of the noise added to the pressure signal,
        which is passed to the trigger function. Unit is in Pa.
    Parachute.noise_corr : tuple, list
        Tuple with the correlation between noise and time.
    Parachute.noise_signal : list of tuple
        List of (t, noise signal) corresponding to signal passed to
        trigger function. Completed after running a simulation.
    Parachute.noisy_pressure_signal : list of tuple
        List of (t, noisy pressure signal) that is passed to the
        trigger function. Completed after running a simulation.
    Parachute.clean_pressure_signal : list of tuple
        List of (t, clean pressure signal) corresponding to signal passed to
        trigger function. Completed after running a simulation.
    Parachute.noise_signal_function : Function
        Function of noiseSignal.
    Parachute.noisy_pressure_signal_function : Function
        Function of noisy_pressure_signal.
    Parachute.clean_pressure_signal_function : Function
        Function of clean_pressure_signal.

                    The function should return ``True`` if the parachute \
                    ejection system should be triggered and ``False`` otherwise.
            - A float value, representing an absolute height in meters. In this \

                height above ground level.

                when the rocket reaches its highest point and starts descending.

                The function will be called according to the sampling rate specified.
        sampling_rate : float
            Sampling rate in which the parachute trigger will be checked at.
            It is used to simulate the refresh rate of onboard sensors such
            as barometers. Default value is 100. Value must be given in hertz.
        lag : float, optional
            Time between the parachute ejection system is triggered and the
            parachute is fully opened. During this time, the simulation will
            consider the rocket as flying without a parachute. Default value
            is 0. Must be given in seconds.
        noise : tuple, list, optional
            List in the format (mean, standard deviation, time-correlation).
            The values are used to add noise to the pressure signal which is
            passed to the trigger function. Default value is ``(0, 0, 0)``.
