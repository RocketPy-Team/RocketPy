            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the inertia tensor

            I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the component of the inertia tensor
            in the direction of e_i x e_j. Alternatively, the inertia tensor can
            be given as (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0. This
            can also be called as "rocket dry inertia tensor".

            Position, in m, of the rocket's center of mass without motor
            relative to the rocket's coordinate system. Default is 0, which

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of fins, must be greater than 2.
        shape_points : list
            List of tuples (x, y) containing the coordinates of the fin's
            geometry defining points. The point (0, 0) is the root leading edge.
            Positive x is rearwards, positive y is upwards (span direction).
            The shape will be interpolated between the points, in the order
            they are given. The last point connects to the first point.
        position : int, float
            Fin set position relative to the rocket's coordinate system.
            By fin set position, understand the point belonging to the root
            chord which is highest in the rocket coordinate system (i.e.
            the point closest to the nose cone tip).

            :ref:`positions`
        cant_angle : int, float, optional
            Fins cant angle with respect to the rocket centerline. Must
            be given in degrees.
        radius : int, float, optional
            Reference fuselage radius where the fins are located. This is used
            to calculate lift coefficient and to draw the rocket. If None,
            which is default, the rocket radius will be used.
        airfoil : tuple, optional
            Default is null, in which case fins will be treated as flat plates.
            Otherwise, if tuple, fins will be considered as airfoils. The
            tuple's first item specifies the airfoil's lift coefficient
            by angle of attack and must be either a .csv, .txt, ndarray
            or callable. The .csv and .txt files can contain a single line
            header and the first column must specify the angle of attack, while
            the second column must specify the lift coefficient. The
            ndarray should be as [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]
            where x0 is the angle of attack and y0 is the lift coefficient.
            If callable, it should take an angle of attack as input and
            return the lift coefficient at that angle of attack.
            The tuple's second item is the unit of the angle of attack,
            accepting either "radians" or "degrees".

                1. Freestream pressure in pascals.
                2. Height in meters above ground level.
                3. The state vector of the simulation, which is defined as: \

                        u = [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, e0, e1, e2, e3, wx, wy, wz]

                .. note::

                    The function should return ``True`` if the parachute \
                    ejection system should be triggered and ``False`` otherwise.
            - A float value, representing an absolute height in meters. In this \
                case, the parachute will be ejected when the rocket reaches this \
                height above ground level.
            - The string "apogee" which triggers the parachute at apogee, i.e., \
                when the rocket reaches its highest point and starts descending.

            .. note::

                The function will be called according to the sampling rate specified.
        sampling_rate : float, optional
            Sampling rate in which the trigger function works. It is used to
            simulate the refresh rate of onboard sensors such as barometers.
            Default value is 100. Value must be given in hertz.
        lag : float, optional
            Time between the parachute ejection system is triggered and the
            parachute is fully opened. During this time, the simulation will
            consider the rocket as flying without a parachute. Default value
            is 0. Must be given in seconds.
        noise : tuple, list, optional
            List in the format (mean, standard deviation, time-correlation).
            The values are used to add noise to the pressure signal which is
            passed to the trigger function. Default value is (0, 0, 0). Units

        Parameters
        ----------
        drag_coefficient_curve : int, float, callable, array, string, Function
            This parameter represents the drag coefficient associated with the
            air brakes and/or the entire rocket, depending on the value of
            ``override_rocket_drag``.

            - If a constant, it should be an integer or a float representing a
              fixed drag coefficient value.
            - If a function, it must take two parameters: deployment level and
              Mach number, and return the drag coefficient. This function allows
              for dynamic computation based on deployment and Mach number.
            - If an array, it should be a 2D array with three columns: the first
              column for deployment level, the second for Mach number, and the
              third for the corresponding drag coefficient.
            - If a string, it should be the path to a .csv or .txt file. The
              file must contain three columns: the first for deployment level,
              the second for Mach number, and the third for the drag
              coefficient.
            - If a Function, it must take two parameters: deployment level and
              Mach number, and return the drag coefficient.

            .. note:: For ``override_rocket_drag = False``, at
                deployment level 0, the drag coefficient is assumed to be 0,
                independent of the input drag coefficient curve. This means that
                the simulation always considers that at a deployment level of 0,
                the air brakes are completely retracted and do not contribute to
                the drag of the rocket.

        controller_function : function, callable
            An user-defined function responsible for controlling the simulation.
            This function is expected to take the following arguments, in order:

            1. `time` (float): The current simulation time in seconds.
            2. `sampling_rate` (float): The rate at which the controller
               function is called, measured in Hertz (Hz).
            3. `state` (list): The state vector of the simulation, structured as
               `[x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, e0, e1, e2, e3, wx, wy, wz]`.
            4. `state_history` (list): A record of the rocket's state at each
               step throughout the simulation. The state_history is organized as a
               list of lists, with each sublist containing a state vector. The last
               item in the list always corresponds to the previous state vector,
               providing a chronological sequence of the rocket's evolving states.
            5. `observed_variables` (list): A list containing the variables that
               the controller function returns. The initial value in the first
               step of the simulation of this list is provided by the
               `initial_observed_variables` argument.
            6. `interactive_objects` (list): A list containing the objects that
               the controller function can interact with. The objects are
               listed in the same order as they are provided in the
               `interactive_objects`
            7. `sensors` (list): A list of sensors that are attached to the
                rocket. The most recent measurements of the sensors are provided
                with the ``sensor.measurement`` attribute. The sensors are
                listed in the same order as they are added to the rocket
               ``interactive_objects``

            This function will be called during the simulation at the specified
            sampling rate. The function should evaluate and change the observed
            objects as needed. The function should return None.

            .. note::

                The function will be called according to the sampling rate specified.

        sampling_rate : float
            The sampling rate of the controller function in Hertz (Hz). This
            means that the controller function will be called every
            `1/sampling_rate` seconds.
        clamp : bool, optional
            If True, the simulation will clamp the deployment level to 0 or 1 if
            the deployment level is out of bounds. If False, the simulation will
            not clamp the deployment level and will instead raise a warning if
            the deployment level is out of bounds. Default is True.
        reference_area : float, optional
            Reference area used to calculate the drag force of the air brakes
            from the drag coefficient curve. If None, which is default, use
            rocket section area. Must be given in squared meters.
        initial_observed_variables : list, optional
            A list of the initial values of the variables that the controller
            function returns. This list is used to initialize the
            `observed_variables` argument of the controller function. The
            default value is None, which initializes the list as an empty list.
        override_rocket_drag : bool, optional
            If False, the air brakes drag coefficient will be added to the
            rocket's power off drag coefficient curve. If True, during the
            simulation, the rocket's power off drag will be ignored and the air
            brakes drag coefficient will be used for the entire rocket instead.
            Default is False.
        return_controller : bool, optional
            If True, the function will return the controller object created.
            Default is False.
        name : string, optional
            AirBrakes name, such as drogue and main. Has no impact in
            simulation, as it is only used to display data in a more
            organized matter.

        plane : str, optional
            Plane in which the rocket will be drawn. Default is 'xz'. Other
            options is 'yz'. Used only for sensors representation.
        filename : str | None, optional
            The path the plot should be saved to. By default None, in which case
            the plot will be shown instead of saved. Supported file endings are:
            eps, jpg, jpeg, pdf, pgf, png, ps, raw, rgba, svg, svgz, tif, tiff
            and webp (these are the formats supported by matplotlib).
