            Tuple or list containing the rocket's dry mass inertia tensor
            components, in kg*m^2.
            Assuming e_3 is the rocket's axis of symmetry, e_1 and e_2 are
            orthogonal and form a plane perpendicular to e_3, the dry mass
            inertia tensor components must be given in the following order:
            (I_11, I_22, I_33, I_12, I_13, I_23), where I_ij is the
            component of the inertia tensor in the direction of e_i x e_j.
            Alternatively, the inertia tensor can be given as
            (I_11, I_22, I_33), where I_12 = I_13 = I_23 = 0.
        power_off_drag : int, float, callable, string, array

            Position, in m, of the rocket's center of mass without motor
            relative to the rocket's coordinate system. Default is 0, which
            means the center of dry mass is chosen as the origin, to comply

            other positions specified. The two options available are:

        Parameters
        ----------
        name : string
            Parachute name, such as drogue and main. Has no impact in
            simulation, as it is only used to display data in a more
            organized matter.
        cd_s : float
            Drag coefficient times reference area for parachute. It is
            used to compute the drag force exerted on the parachute by
            the equation F = ((1/2)*rho*V^2)*cd_s, that is, the drag
            force is the dynamic pressure computed on the parachute
            times its cd_s coefficient. Has units of area and must be
            given in squared meters.
        trigger : function, float, string
            This parameter defines the trigger condition for the parachute
            ejection system. It can be one of the following:

            - A callable function that takes three arguments:
                1. Freestream pressure in pascals.
                2. Height in meters above ground level.
                3. The state vector of the simulation, which is defined as:
                    [x, y, z, vx, vy, vz, e0, e1, e2, e3, wx, wy, wz].

            The function should return True if the parachute ejection system should
            be triggered and False otherwise.

            - A float value, representing an absolute height in meters. In this
            case, the parachute will be ejected when the rocket reaches this height
            above ground level.

            - The string "apogee," which triggers the parachute at apogee, i.e.,
            when the rocket reaches its highest point and starts descending.

            Note: The function will be called according to the sampling rate
            specified next.
        sampling_rate : float, optional
            Sampling rate in which the trigger function works. It is used to
            simulate the refresh rate of onboard sensors such as barometers.
            Default value is 100. Value must be given in hertz.
        lag : float, optional
            Time between the parachute ejection system is triggered and the
            parachute is fully opened. During this time, the simulation will
            consider the rocket as flying without a parachute. Default value
            is 0. Must be given in seconds.
        noise : tuple, list, optional
            List in the format (mean, standard deviation, time-correlation).
            The values are used to add noise to the pressure signal which is
            passed to the trigger function. Default value is (0, 0, 0). Units
            are in pascal.

            Angular position of the rail buttons in degrees measured
