class FreeFormFin(_FreeFormMixin, Fins):
    """Class that defines and holds information for a free form fin set.

    This class inherits from the Fins class.

    Note
    ----
    Local coordinate system:
        - Origin located at the top of the root chord.
        - Z axis along the longitudinal axis of symmetry, positive downwards (top -> bottom).
        - Y axis perpendicular to the Z axis, in the span direction, positive upwards.
        - X axis completes the right-handed coordinate system.

        Parameters
        ----------
        n : int
            Number of fins, must be larger than 2.
        shape_points : list
            List of tuples (x, y) containing the coordinates of the fin's
            geometry defining points. The point (0, 0) is the root leading edge.
            Positive x is rearwards, positive y is upwards (span direction).
            The shape will be interpolated between the points, in the order
            they are given. The last point connects to the first point, and
            represents the trailing edge.
        rocket_radius : int, float
            Reference radius to calculate lift coefficient, in meters.
        cant_angle : int, float, optional
            Fins cant angle with respect to the rocket centerline. Must
            be given in degrees.
        airfoil : tuple, optional
            Default is null, in which case fins will be treated as flat plates.
            Otherwise, if tuple, fins will be considered as airfoils. The
            tuple's first item specifies the airfoil's lift coefficient
            by angle of attack and must be either a .csv, .txt, ndarray
            or callable. The .csv and .txt files can contain a single line
            header and the first column must specify the angle of attack, while
            the second column must specify the lift coefficient. The
            ndarray should be as [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ...]
            where x0 is the angle of attack and y0 is the lift coefficient.
            If callable, it should take an angle of attack as input and
            return the lift coefficient at that angle of attack.
            The tuple's second item is the unit of the angle of attack,
            accepting either "radians" or "degrees".
        name : str
            Name of fin set.
