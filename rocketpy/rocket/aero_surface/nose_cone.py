    Note
    ----
    Local coordinate system:
        - the origin at the tip of the nose cone and
        - the Z axis along the longitudinal axis of symmetry, positive downwards (top -> bottom).

    Attributes
    ----------
    NoseCone.length : float
        Nose cone length. Has units of length and must be given in meters.
    NoseCone.kind : string
        Nose cone kind. Can be "conical", "ogive", "elliptical", "tangent",
        "von karman", "parabolic", "powerseries" or "lvhaack".
    NoseCone.bluffness : float
        Ratio between the radius of the circle on the tip of the ogive and the
        radius of the base of the ogive. Currently only used for the nose cone's
        drawing. Must be between 0 and 1. Default is None, which means that the
        nose cone will not have a sphere on the tip. If a value is given, the
        nose cone's length will be slightly reduced because of the addition of
        the sphere. Must be None or 0 if a "powerseries" nose cone kind is
        specified.
    NoseCone.rocket_radius : float
        The reference rocket radius used for lift coefficient normalization,
        in meters.
    NoseCone.base_radius : float
        Nose cone base radius. Has units of length and must be given in meters.
    NoseCone.radius_ratio : float
        Ratio between the nose cone base radius and the rocket radius. Has no
        units. If base radius is not given, the ratio between base radius and
        rocket radius is assumed as 1, meaning that the nose cone has the same
        radius as the rocket. If base radius is given, the ratio between base
        radius and rocket radius is calculated and used for lift calculation.
    NoseCone.power : float
        Factor that controls the bluntness of the shape for a power series
        nose cone. Must be between 0 and 1. It is ignored when other nose
        cone types are used.
    NoseCone.name : string
        Nose cone name. Has no impact in simulation, as it is only used to
        display data in a more organized matter.
    NoseCone.cp : tuple
        Tuple with the x, y and z local coordinates of the nose cone center of
        pressure. Has units of length and is given in meters.
    NoseCone.cpx : float
        Nose cone local center of pressure x coordinate. Has units of length and
        is given in meters.
    NoseCone.cpy : float
        Nose cone local center of pressure y coordinate. Has units of length and
        is given in meters.
    NoseCone.cpz : float
        Nose cone local center of pressure z coordinate. Has units of length and
        is given in meters.
    NoseCone.cl : Function
        Function which defines the lift coefficient as a function of the angle
        of attack and the Mach number. Takes as input the angle of attack in
        radians and the Mach number. Returns the lift coefficient.
    NoseCone.clalpha : float
        Lift coefficient slope. Has units of 1/rad.
    NoseCone.plots : plots.aero_surface_plots._NoseConePlots
        This contains all the plots methods. Use help(NoseCone.plots) to know
        more about it.
    NoseCone.prints : prints.aero_surface_prints._NoseConePrints
        This contains all the prints methods. Use help(NoseCone.prints) to know
        more about it.
