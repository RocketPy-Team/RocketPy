"""rocketpy/prints/flight_prints.py

This module contains the _FlightPrints class, which is responsible for printing
flight information in a user-friendly manner.

Notes
-----
- This module does not have any external dependencies (avoid importing libraries).
- We assume that all flight information is valid, no validation checks is run.
- Avoid calculating values here, only print the values from the Flight class.
- The _FlightPrints is a private class, it is subjected to change without notice.
